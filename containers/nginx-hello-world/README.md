# NGINX hello world

This demonstrates a simple example of running the [NGINX base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) on [Scaleway Serverless Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-containers/).

## Requirements

This example assumes you are familiar with how serverless containers work. If needed, you can
check the [Scaleway official documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/quickstart/).

This example uses the Scaleway Serverless Framework Plugin. Please set up your environment with the requirements stated in the [Scaleway Serverless Framework Plugin](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions) before trying out the example.

## Deployment

Once your environment is set up, you can deploy your container with:

```sh
npm install

serverless deploy
```

When the deployment is complete, you should be able to `curl` the container's endpoint or hit it from a browser and see the NGINX default page.

## Customising your deployment

To serve custom resource from your NGINX container, you will need to:

- Build a custom image containing these files
- Push this image to a publicly accessible repo, or a private Scaleway container repo
- Update the `registryImage` field in the `serverless.yml` file to point to your image, and redeploy
