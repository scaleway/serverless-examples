# Triggers Getting Started

Simple starter examples that showcase using SQS triggers in all Scaleway Functions supported languages.

In each example, a function is triggered by a SQS queue with a message containing a number. The function will then print the factorial of this number to the logs.

## Requirements

This example requires [Terraform](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/terraform-quickstart/).

Also, SQS **must** be [activated](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns) on your project.

## Setup

The Terraform configuration will deploy a function for each language, showing how to use triggers with each language.

It will also create a SQS queue per function to trigger it.

After exporting `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`, `SCW_SECRET_KEY` and `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID` variables (for authentication), you can:

```console
terraform init
terraform apply
```

You should be able to see your resources in the Scaleway console:

- Queues can be found in the [MnQ section](https://console.scaleway.com/messaging/protocols/fr-par/sqs/queues)
- Functions can be found in the `triggers-getting-started` namespace in the [Serverless functions section](https://console.scaleway.com/functions/namespaces)

## Running

You can trigger your functions by sending messages to any of the associated SQS queues. Below is a description of how to do this with our dummy `tests/send_messages.py` script.

### Setup

First you need to expose your SQS access and secret keys:

```console
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(terraform output -raw sqs_access_key)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(terraform output -raw sqs_secret_key)
```

Then you can set up a Python environment in the `tests` directory, e.g.

```console
cd tests
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sending messages

Now you can run the `send_messages.py` script to send a message to the SQS queue of each function:

```console
python3 send_messages.py
```

### Viewing function logs

In your [Cockpit](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit), you can access the logs from your queues and functions.

Navigate from your Cockpit to Grafana, and find the `Serverless Functions Logs` dashboard. There you should see something like the following, showing that your functions were triggered by messages on the queues:

```console
...
DEBUG - php: factorial of 17 is 355687428096000 source=user stream=stdout
2023-09-11 10:36:19.994 DEBUG - Function Triggered: / source=core

2023-09-11 10:36:19.954 DEBUG - php: factorial of 4 is 24 source=user stream=stdout
2023-09-11 10:36:19.948 DEBUG - php: factorial of 0 is 1 source=user stream=stdout
... (truncated)
```

If you don't see these logs, make sure you have selected one of the "triggers getting started" functions in the `Function name` dropdown.

### Costs

Configuring and managing triggers is free, you only pay for the execution of your functions. For more information, please consult the [Scaleway Serverless pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=serverless). You will also be billed for the SQS queue usage when sending messages to it.

## Cleanup

To delete all the resources used in this example, you can run the following from the root of the project:

```console
terraform destroy
```
