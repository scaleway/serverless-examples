# Interact with a PostgreSQL database using functions

## Requirements

This example assumes that you are familiar with some products of Scaleway's ecosystem: 
 * how serverless functions work. If needed, you can check [Scaleway official documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/functions/quickstart/).
 * how a managed database for PostgreSQL works, and especially how to create a database and create users with appropriate permissions. Please refer to scaleway's documentation [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/).

This example uses the Scaleway Serverless Framework Plugin. Please set up your environment with the requirements stated in the [Scaleway Serverless Framework Plugin](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions) before trying out the example.


## Context

This example shows how to connect to a managed PostgreSQL database and perform a query on it. This example can be extended to adding, deleting, or processing data within a database.


## Description

The function connects to a PostgreSQL database and performs an example query on it. This example uses Node 18 runtime. Used packages are specified in `package.json`.

## Setup

### Create a managed PostgreSQL database 

Create a PostgreSQL database and a user profile with appropriate access permissions.

### Fill environment variables

Fill your secrets within `serverless.yml` file:

```
secret:
    PG_HOST: "your host IP address"
    PG_USER: "your database username"
    PG_DATABASE: "your database name"
    PG_PASSWORD: "your databse user password"
    PG_PORT: "your database port"
```

### Install npm modules

Once your environment is set up, you can install `npm` dependencies from `package.json` file using:

```
npm install
```

### Deploy and call the function

Then deploy your function and get its URL using:

```
serverless deploy
```

From the given function URL, you can run your function using:

```
curl <function URL>
```
